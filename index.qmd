## MMK Testing
## Introduction to Figure 1

- **Title:** Green Industrial Policy Activity in G20 Countries (2010–2022)
- **What it shows:**
  - Annual green policy activity for Middle-income vs. High-income countries
  - Indexed to 2010–2012 average = 100
  - High-income line is scaled (divided by 5) for visual comparison
- **Axes:**
  - Left Y-axis: Middle-income index
  - Right Y-axis: High-income index (scaled)

## Code Logic Overview

1. **Deduplicate policies**
   - One row per MeasureID–Year–Country
2. **Classify countries**
   - Manually assign to High or Middle income group
3. **Count policies**
   - Policies per income group, per year
4. **Compute baseline**
   - Average policy count (2010–2012)
5. **Create index**
   - Normalize: `(policy_count / baseline_avg) * 1000`
6. **Plot with scaling**
   - High-income index scaled by 5 for visual clarity

Green Industrial Policy Activity in G20 Countries, 2010–2022  
(Annual Count of Policies Relative to 2010–2012 Average)

**Source**: Green industrial policies are classified based on the industrial policies identified in *Juhász et al. (2022)* using Global Trade Alert.  
High- and middle-income status is classified using data from the *World Bank*.

## Code Block Summary

## Future Work & Exploration

- Adjust scaling dynamically (not fixed `/5`)
- Add subcategories (e.g., carbon tax, renewables)
- Track regional patterns
- Link policies to actual emissions or investment outcomes
